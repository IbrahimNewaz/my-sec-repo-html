                    C++ is a powerful, general-purpose programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, evolving from the C language to incorporate object-oriented programming (OOP) features. It offers high performance and low-level memory control, making it ideal for system programming, game development, operating systems, embedded systems, and other performance-critical applications. Its versatility and efficiency have kept it a widely used and influential language in the world of software development.
